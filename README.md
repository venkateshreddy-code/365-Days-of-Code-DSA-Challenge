365 Days of Code – DSA Challenge

This repository is dedicated to a year-long commitment of solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems every day. The purpose is to strengthen problem-solving skills, improve coding efficiency, and build a solid foundation for technical interviews.

Repository Structure

Each folder is named by Day-XX.

Each folder contains one or more solutions with clean, well-documented code.

Solutions are implemented in Java, Python, or C++ depending on the problem.

Objectives

Develop consistency through daily practice

Enhance algorithmic thinking and problem-solving strategies

Gain mastery over common data structures and algorithms

Prepare effectively for coding interviews and competitive programming

Tech Stack

Languages: Java, Python, C++

Platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks
